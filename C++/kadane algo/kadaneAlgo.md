The primary goal of Kadane's Algorithm is to find the subarray with the maximum sum in an efficient way, 
with a time complexity of O(n), where "n" is the number of elements in the input array.
### How the algorithm works:

### What we Had Done in KadaneAlgo :
 
 # We use a std::vector<int> to represent the input array.
 # The maxSubarraySum function takes the input vector as an argument and returns the maximum subarray sum.
 # The algorithm follows the same logic as explained in the previous JavaScript example.
# In the main function, we create an input vector and call maxSubarraySum to find the maximum subarray sum.
 # Finally, we print the result to the console.


When you run this C++ program, it will output the maximum subarray sum for the given input array. In this example, the output will be 6 for the subarray [4, -1, 2, 1].
